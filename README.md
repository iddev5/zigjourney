# Documenting my journey of learning Zig programming language
This repository will house all my Zig projects until I become sufficently confident in using this language with my C projects.
I m a total beginner in Zig (as of writing this), so my code would probably be low standard and such.
My start is simple and small...  

My end goal is to master this language (or know it as much as I know C). Zig seems to be the language of the future. 
Its like C but perfect. Thanks to all the developers, maintainer and contributors of Zig and dependent projects for everything. 
Also thanks to the imaginary person reading this :p
